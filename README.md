**📊 Databel Telecom – Customer Churn Analysis (Power BI Case Study)**

This project is a complete customer churn analysis conducted in Power BI Desktop using a fictional telecom dataset from Databel. The goal is to identify the main drivers of churn (customer attrition), understand customer behavior, and present insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

**⭐ Project Summary**

This case study demonstrates an end-to-end analytics workflow:
- validating and preparing the churn dataset
- exploring patterns across demographics, plans, and service usage
- building DAX measures for churn rate and KPIs
- developing visuals that highlight churn drivers
- assembling the insights into a clear, interactive Power BI dashboard

The final report is designed for business stakeholders who need to understand why customers leave and where the company can intervene.

**Data Analysis Workflow**

This project follows the five-step data analysis flow used in real Power BI engagements.

1. Data Check (Quality Review)
- Verified column types and formats
- Checked for missing values or anomalies
- Confirmed churn labels (“Yes” / “No”)
- Cross-referenced the metadata sheet for accuracy

2. Data Exploration
Asked key analytical questions such as:
- Do monthly charges correlate with churn?
- Are month-to-month contract holders more likely to leave?
- Does lack of tech support or high service usage affect churn?
- Which demographic groups churn the most?

3. Analyze & Visualize
Built targeted visuals and measures to uncover insights:
- Churn rate (%)
- Churn by contract type
- Churn by age, gender, partner status
- Impact of internet type, tech support, and premium services
- Financial indicators: monthly vs total charges

4. Build Dashboards
Designed a multi-section dashboard that includes:
- KPIs (Total Customers, Churned Customers, Churn Rate)
- Customer profile segmentation
- Contract & service analysis
- Billing and revenue analysis
- Interactive filters for deeper exploration

5. Communicate Insights
The final report consolidates the analysis into an accessible Power BI interface for stakeholders, enabling them to explore churn drivers and take action.

**Dataset Overview**
The Databel dataset contains 29 columns with one row per customer. Key fields include:
- Customer_id (unique identifier)
- Churn Label (Yes / No)
- Demographics (age, gender, dependents, partner)
- Account Details (tenure, contract, billing type, payment method)
- Services (phone, internet, streaming, tech support, etc.)
- Billing (Monthly Charges, Total Charges)
- The data represents a static snapshot — no time-based records.

**Dashboard Features**
The Power BI dashboard includes:
- Churn KPIs and summary cards
- Bar charts, donut charts, and filters
- Churn by demographics
- Churn by contract type
- Service-level churn impacts
- Monthly vs Total Charges analysis
- Fully interactive slicers and drilldowns
- Designed for clarity, business interpretation, and smooth navigation.

This project demonstrates the ability to perform a full analytical cycle using Power BI — from data validation to visual storytelling. It showcases strong skills in:
- BI dashboard development
- Exploratory and explanatory analytics
- DAX and Power BI modeling
- Data-driven storytelling
- Stakeholder communication
