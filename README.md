# **📊 Databel Telecom – Customer Churn Analysis (Power BI Case Study)**

This project is a complete customer churn analysis conducted in Power BI Desktop using a fictional telecom dataset from Databel. The goal is to identify the main drivers of churn (customer attrition), understand customer behavior, and present insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## **⭐ Project Summary**

This case study demonstrates an end-to-end analytics workflow:
- validating and preparing the churn dataset
- exploring patterns across demographics, plans, and service usage
- building DAX measures for churn rate and KPIs
- developing visuals that highlight churn drivers
- assembling the insights into a clear, interactive Power BI dashboard

The final report is designed for business stakeholders who need to understand why customers leave and where the company can intervene.

## **Data Analysis Workflow**

This project follows the five-step data analysis flow used in real Power BI engagements.

_**1. Data Check (Quality Review)**_
- Verified column types and formats
- Checked for missing values or anomalies
- Confirmed churn labels (“Yes” / “No”)
- Cross-referenced the metadata sheet for accuracy

_**2. Data Exploration**_
Asked key analytical questions such as:
- Do monthly charges correlate with churn?
- Are month-to-month contract holders more likely to leave?
- Does lack of tech support or high service usage affect churn?
- Which demographic groups churn the most?

_**3. Analyze & Visualize**_
Built targeted visuals and measures to uncover insights:
- Churn rate (%)
- Churn by contract type
- Churn by age, gender, partner status
- Impact of internet type, tech support, and premium services
- Financial indicators: monthly vs total charges

_**4. Build Dashboards**_
Designed a multi-section dashboard that includes:
- KPIs (Total Customers, Churned Customers, Churn Rate)
- Customer profile segmentation
- Contract & service analysis
- Billing and revenue analysis
- Interactive filters for deeper exploration

_**5. Communicate Insights**_
   
The final report consolidates the analysis into an accessible Power BI interface for stakeholders, enabling them to explore churn drivers and take action.

## **Dataset Overview**

The Databel dataset contains 29 columns with one row per customer. Key fields include:
- Customer_id (unique identifier)
- Churn Label (Yes / No)
- Demographics (age, gender, dependents, partner)
- Account Details (tenure, contract, billing type, payment method)
- Services (phone, internet, streaming, tech support, etc.)
- Billing (Monthly Charges, Total Charges)
- The data represents a static snapshot — no time-based records.

## **Dashboard Features**

The Power BI dashboard includes:
- Churn KPIs and summary cards
- Bar charts, donut charts, and filters
- Churn by demographics
- Churn by contract type
- Service-level churn impacts
- Monthly vs Total Charges analysis
- Fully interactive slicers and drilldowns
- Designed for clarity, business interpretation, and smooth navigation.

This project demonstrates the ability to perform a full analytical cycle using Power BI — from data validation to visual storytelling. It showcases strong skills in:
- BI dashboard development
- Exploratory and explanatory analytics
- DAX and Power BI modeling
- Data-driven storytelling
- Stakeholder communication
